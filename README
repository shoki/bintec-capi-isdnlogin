UNIX ISDNLogin Client for BinTec Remote CAPI
============================================

On BinTec ISDN routers there is a isdnlogin command to either log into remote 
routers over an ISDN line or to just test ISDN connectivity with several 
bearers or services. If you don't have a BinTec ISDN router this tool has no
for you. :)

This tool aims to do the same using the freely available BinTec UNIX Remote 
CAPI library on a UNIX box.

Make sure to adjust the Makefile to point to the directory where you compiled 
the CAPI library because we link it statically into the binary. It should be 
at least version 1.7.

Also don't forget to set the apropriate environment vars required by the CAPI 
lib.

When typing ~. while connected you can quit the current connection if the 
remote side is no longer responding.
